# ðŸ“Š Power BI Learning Project â€“ Classic Models Dashboard

## ðŸš€ Project Overview

This Power BI project marks the beginning of my data analytics journey. I used the **Classic Models dataset** to create an interactive and insightful dashboard. Through this project, I explored and practiced various essential features of Power BIâ€”from data cleaning to data visualizationâ€”while developing a business-focused report that displays key performance metrics for a fictional classic car sales company.

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective

- Learn the core functionalities of Power BI through hands-on practice.
- Understand the data modeling process, relationships, and DAX calculations.
- Create an interactive dashboard with slicers, cards, charts, and tables.
- Showcase KPIs, sales trends, and customer insights.

## ðŸ§° Tools & Technologies Used

- **Power BI Desktop**
- **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)**
- **Power Query Editor**
- **Classic Models Dataset** (tables like customers, orders, products, payments, employees, etc.)

## ðŸ’¡ Key Learnings

- **Data Loading & Cleaning**: Used Power Query to transform and clean raw data.
- **Data Modeling**: Established relationships between multiple tables using primary/foreign keys.
- **DAX Measures**: Created custom measures such as Total Sales, Average Order Value, and Number of Orders.
- **Visualization**: Built intuitive visuals like bar charts, pie charts, line graphs, cards, and KPIs.
- **Interactivity**: Enabled features like drill-through, slicers, and tooltips to improve usability.
